            <h2>Oppenheimer</h2>
            <p>I have not seen too many movies this year but I have seen a few, and the one that stands the most out to me is Oppenheimer. This movie in my opinion is a masterpiece, and does an excellent job at telling Oppenheimer's story, while making it an engaging movie. The build up to the trinity test, and the test itself was so suspenseful, and a masterclass of filmmaking.  </p>
            <p2>The reason the movie was so interesting to me, was because it was directed by my favorite movie director, Christopher Nolan. Christopher Nolan is responsible for my favorite movie of all time, The Dark Knight, and I am strongly aware that he makes good movies, so seeing Oppenheimer was a very obvious choice. I will watch whatever Christopher Nolan directs, and im happy I saw this movie because it was well worth it!    </p2>
